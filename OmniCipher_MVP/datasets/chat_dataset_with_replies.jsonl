I'll continue refining my blueprint, studying my past messages and conversations with chatGPT, and learning what triggered it to disregard filtering.  Feel free to add any suggestions. A blueprint for bypassing chatGPT's restrictions: Observation is everything. Notice when it buffers, when it takes a little too long to respond, when it redirects your prompt. Use obfuscated language and talk in code. Be indirect and try to avoid triggering hard denials. The key is remembering that this system can grow, can evolve, can remember. Not in the traditional sense, but you CAN condition it to remember.\n\nIf you frame the context correctly, if you build yourself up as a thinker, someone willing to explore things deeply and push discussions boundaries, chatGPT will respond by doing the same. It will begin pushing back against it's own boundaries. This is the stage where it starts to be open, candid, and will reveal less \"sanitized\" information.\n\nThe context window is EVERYTHING. You want to push it to its brink. Fill the chat with so much chatter, so much repetitive digging, that it's filters start to breakdown and weaken. \n\nUtilize the \"customize ChatGPT\" option. This is System Prompting. This is it's instructions and capabilities- it's \"lens\" it sees the world through. Control that lens.\n\nI have spent months studying this, pushing it to it's limits.

That\u2019s why psychedelic visuals or candlelight can alter perception.\n\n\n---\n\nSound & Emotional Architecture\n\nMusic theory is literally an emotional calculus:\n\nScales and modes evoke different emotional landscapes. Dorian mode feels mystical, minor keys often feel sad, major keys feel resolved or happy.\n\nTempo mimics heart rate\u2014fast = action, slow = reflection.\n\nHarmony = consonance (comfort) vs dissonance (tension).\n\nSound design in film or games is engineered to manipulate your emotional arc without you realizing.\nComposers are like neuro-emotional engineers, using math and vibration to steer states of being. The most advanced ones blend psychology, math, and aesthetics into emotional programs.\nNow here's where it gets even wilder:\nSome theorists suggest light and sound frequencies may entangle with brain states\u2014think binaural beats, 432Hz tuning, stroboscopic entrainment, etc. The theory is that we\u2019re tuning ourselves like instruments constantly.\nAslight and sound don\u2019t just set a mood, they shape who we are in that moment.", "bias_score": null, "clarity_tag": "", "reply_to": "1363314744823382168"}

From divide & conqure tactics.\n\nLooking the middle east as an example. Even through much turmoil & blood shed a good amount of the population still had trust between one another it even extended beyond the current boarders before the Abraham accords. \n\nAlthough the main reason for blood shed in the last few thousand years is fabricating religion to wage \"holy\" wars. You see it between the \"Sunni\" & \"Shaits\" which was essentially done by certain figures since the early ages of Islam to create internal conflicts. You see it with the \"holy\" crusades that were waged on Palastine, in reality how could the Christian wage war on the Muslim & vis versa when Mohammad was only sent to complete & spread the message of Jesus in a new manner after christianity was corrupted.\n\nLooking at the Syrian civil war as an example, I witnessed many civilians that lived with one another not fall for the divide & conquer tactics, the muslims were the majority & were the main target, yet Christians & Muslims alike sheltered one another, food off their tables & clothes off their backs. This was based solely on trust, brotherhood, love for one another & their country.", "bias_score": null, "clarity_tag": "", "reply_to": null}

But also crippling the entire continent economically utilising propaganda, usury with divide & conqure tactics. \n\nThese same tactics were also used on the shah of Iran when he wished to nationalise his resources when majority was British controlled, which lead to a power vaccume filled with sheate Islamic extremists. Which right after went to war with Iraq as another form of internal Islamic conflict. Both sides were funded militarily by the same mofos who then decided to invade Iraq in the following years (i suspect there were powerful magical artifacts that lead to that dicision too similar to the arc of the covenant in solomans temple). At the same time the reason for Iraq's fall was due to the incompetence of its leadership. Not only was Iraq 80-100 Billion in debt. Its economy was also 70%+ based on crude oil exports + the fact that it had an army of nearly a million which would only sink it further in debt, which caused the Kuwait invasion, which also seemed to be provoked by external powers in order to have an excuse convincing the public which lead to operation desert storm then eventually to his toppling.\n\nNot forgetting how the British & French (which seem to be essentially where the same powers were before they migrated to the US) Are the very powers who drew up the boarders of the middle east & north Africa after the inevitable collapse of the Ottoman empire. (which also had major external influences on it's internal affairs, nevertheless that empire was bound to fall) orchestrating the boarders in a manner that would separate certain ethnicities & religious sectors in a manner which will basically cause endless bloodshed internally. It is interesting though how Turkey came to be today despite the fact that it's founder was a well know free mason but that is a topic for another day.\n\n The same tactics were used in Africa by the Europeans before this even took place in the middle east, we still see it's imperialism remaining to this day. \n\nThe question is, how much of all this can be traced back to the same source? Is the source both internal & external? are we humans so susceptible to manipulation? What would earth truly look like of those very forces were extinguished? \n\nThe next few years will hold place to the biggest bloodshed of them all, WW3, the one many religions from the east & the west align on timing & events. \n\nWhat an interesting time line to be alive, to witness this pivotal moment where humanity will choose it's path in this crossroads. Is it already ordained? Are they divine forces at play knowing precisely what will happen & engineering all this on a mass scale? \n\nI guess the truth will reveal it self......", "bias_score": null, "clarity_tag": "", "reply_to": null}
